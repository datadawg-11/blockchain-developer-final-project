A few ideas for my final project. As i venture down the path of blockchain enlightenment i realise that the goal for this assignment is not to create something revolutionary. I think in this project i just want to code up something as a POC and show that it actually works. 

My first project is the decentralised workforce of the future. In the future, i believe their will be increasing mobility and will drive the increase into the freelancer community where people are not confined to certain locations but are allowed to move to different communities and hubs. As a result, there is a huge implications for tax for citizens. 

For example, a freelancer receives ETH for a project. He will then use this ETH to spend on living costs and discretionary items. At the end of the financial year after completing their tax return they realise they are liable for tax on their income however they currently do not have it saved in their account. 

Traditionally, the employer segregates this tax due by paying in advance to the tax authority however for a decentralised workforce their needs a decentralised solution. 

My idea is brocken simply into 
1. Web interface where user generates a metamask account. 
2. The employer pays into this account
3. This account is a smart contract and upon receiving this value splits it 80% 20% where 20% goes into an escrow that is unlocked at the end of the financial year. 
4. The other 80% goes into a user specified account

I believe this system would alleviate some of the pain for freelancers where completing their tax returns.

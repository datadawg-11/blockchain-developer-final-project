# Blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
---
## Abstract - Project Explaination KISS
This project is submitted as part of the Blockchain Developer Bootcamp. The core objective is to demonstrate my understanding of the Ethereum Blockchain and interacting with the EVM through the use of smart contracts. 

The idea is a simplified watered down version of a betting game. Idea is that there are two tiles where individuals can upload their favourite superhero images. Once the two characters have been input, a timer is set in place where outsiders can vote by waving. Whoever gets the most waves by the end of the round wins. 

In a fully built out idea, the voters also send in some money or the vote could cost like this amount of ETH. Whoever wins, gets the pot of the other side according to the number of votes they put in. 

In addition, users will be able to buy their selected items. 

## Tech Stack | Libraries | Frameworks
- Solidity for Smart Contract 
- Remix for initial and localised development
- web3.js for the ethereum web client library
- Ganache for localised testing, migration and deployment
- Truffle for testing, migration and deployment
- Metamask to handle account management 
- React front end javascript library for building web applications
- OpenZeppelin Library

### 

  
## User Workflow
1. Initially the website will have two people to vote for.  timer should be set off initially for a set period. 
2. The users will then be able to send waves/votes to either party based on their preference
3. The votes should populate a wall and the amount of votes bought 
4. Once the time is out, whoever received the most votes win.
